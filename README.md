This paper presents a traffic management system designed to classify and detect traffic levels in real-time using machine learning and computer vision techniques, tested and validated through simulations in SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)\cite{SUMO2018}. The system employs the EfficientNetB0 model for classifying traffic into high, low, and medium categories, achieving superior performance with a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.91 and accuracy of 0.91. For vehicle detection and counting, the YOLOv8x model was used because of its high inference speed up to 100 Frames Per Second and accuracy\cite{8569109}, as demonstrated by consistent car counts with confidence scores ranging from 0.49 to 0.95 across diverse traffic scenes. The solution was tested in SUMO, simulating dynamic urban traffic scenarios, where it effectively optimized traffic flow by adapting to varying densities and conditions. Optimized for deployment on a hardware microcontrollers which use the serial peripheral communication protocol to share this data, analyze it using the models and then manage traffic. This approach highlights the ability to manage traffic in a real world setting while offering a scalable and efficient solution to urban congestion challenges.
